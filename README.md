# Foundations of Algorithms

Following the book *Foundations of Algorithms 5th Edition*.

This project aims to learn basic algorithms knowledge through this book and and practice in [**Ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/ja/).

## about the book

> ***Foundations of Algorithms, Fifth Edition*** offers a well-balanced presentation of algorithm design, complexity analysis of algorithms, and computational complexity. Ideal for any computer science students with a background in college algebra and discrete structures, the text presents mathematical concepts using standard English and simple notation to maximize accessibility and user-friendliness. Concrete examples, appendices reviewing essential mathematical concepts, and a student-focused approach reinforce theoretical explanations and promote learning and retention. C++ and Java pseudocode help students better understand complex algorithms. A chapter on numerical algorithms includes a review of basic number theory, Euclid's Algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor, a review of modular arithmetic, an algorithm for solving modular linear equations, an algorithm for computing modular powers, and the new polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether a number is prime.

> The revised and updated *Fifth Edition* features an all-new chapter on genetic algorithms and genetic programming, including approximate solutions to the traveling salesperson problem, an algorithm for an artificial ant that navigates along a trail of food, and an application to financial trading. With fully updated exercises and examples throughout and improved instructor resources including complete solutions, an Instructorâ€™s Manual and Lecture Slides, ***Foundations of Algorithms*** is an essential text for undergraduate and graduate courses in the design and analysis of algorithms.
